../beginners/basic-ml/tutorial_overfit_underfit/index.html\n  - ../../articles/tutorial_overfit_underfit.html\n---\n\n\nAs always, the code in this example will use the Keras API, which you can learn more about in the TensorFlow [Keras guide](guides/keras).\n\nIn both of the previous examples --- [classifying text](text_classification.qmd) and [predicting fuel efficiency](regression.qmd) --- the accuracy of models on the validation data would peak after training for a number of epochs and then stagnate or start decreasing.\n\nIn other words, your model would *overfit* to the training data.\nLearning how to deal with overfitting is important.\nAlthough it's often possible to achieve high accuracy on the *training set*, what you really want is to develop models that generalize well to a *testing set* (or data they haven't seen before).\n\nThe opposite of overfitting is *underfitting*.\nUnderfitting occurs when there is still room for improvement on the train data.\nThis can happen for a number of reasons: If the model is not powerful enough, is over-regularized, or has simply not been trained long enough.\nThis means the network has not learned the relevant patterns in the training data.\n\nIf you train for too long though, the model will start to overfit and learn patterns from the training data that don't generalize to the test data.\nYou need to strike a balance.\nUnderstanding how to train for an appropriate number of epochs as you'll explore below is a useful skill.\n\nTo prevent overfitting, the best solution is to use more complete training data.\nThe dataset should cover the full range of inputs that the model is expected to handle.\nAdditional data may only be useful if it covers new and interesting cases.\n\nA model trained on more complete data will naturally generalize better.\nWhen that is no longer possible, the next best solution is to use techniques like regularization.\nThese place constraints on the quantity and type of information your model can store.\nIf a network can only afford to memorize a small number of patterns, the optimization process will force it to focus on the most prominent patterns, which have a better chance of generalizing well.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll explore several common regularization techniques, and use them to improve on a classification model.\n\n## Setup\n\nBefore getting started, import the necessary packages:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tensorflow)\nlibrary(keras)\nlibrary(tfdatasets)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlogdir <- tempfile()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## The Higgs dataset\n\nThe goal of this tutorial is not to do particle physics, so don't dwell on the details of the dataset.\nIt contains 11,000,000 examples, each with 28 features, and a binary class label.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngz <- get_file(\n  'HIGGS.csv.gz',\n  'http://mlphysics.ics.uci.edu/data/higgs/HIGGS.csv.gz'\n)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nFEATURES <- 28\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `tf$data$experimental$CsvDataset` class can be used to read csv records directly from a gzip file with no intermediate decompression step.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nds <- tf$data$experimental$CsvDataset(\n  gz,\n  lapply(seq_len(FEATURES + 1), function(x) tf$float32),\n  compression_type = \"GZIP\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThat csv reader class returns a list of scalars for each record.\nThe following function repacks that list of scalars into a (feature_vector, label) pair.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npack_row <- function(...) {\n  row <- list(...)\n  label <- row[[1]]\n  features <- tf$stack(row[2:length(row)], 1L)\n  list(features, label)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nTensorFlow is most efficient when operating on large batches of data.\n\nSo, instead of repacking each row individually make a new `tf$data$Dataset` that takes batches of 10,000 examples, applies the `pack_row` function to each batch, and then splits the batches back up into individual records:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacked_ds <- ds %>%\n  dataset_batch(10000) %>%\n  dataset_map(pack_row)\npacked_ds <- packed_ds$unbatch()\n```\n:::\n\n\nInspect some of the records from this new `packed_ds`.\n\nThe features are not perfectly normalized, but this is sufficient for this tutorial.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbatch <- packed_ds %>%\n  dataset_batch(1000) %>%\n  dataset_take(1) %>%\n  reticulate::as_iterator() %>%\n  reticulate::iter_next()\nstr(batch)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nList of 2\n $ :<tf.Tensor: shape=(1000, 28), dtype=float32, numpy=…>\n $ :<tf.Tensor: shape=(1000), dtype=float32, numpy=…>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo keep this tutorial relatively short, use just the first 1,000 samples for validation, and the next 10,000 for training:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nN_VALIDATION <- 1e3\nN_TRAIN <- 1e4\nBUFFER_SIZE <- 1e4\nBATCH_SIZE <- 500\nSTEPS_PER_EPOCH <- N_TRAIN %/% BATCH_SIZE\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `dataset_skip()` and `dataset_take()` methods make this easy.\n\nAt the same time, use the `dataset_cache()` method to ensure that the loader doesn't need to re-read the data from the file on each epoch:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvalidate_ds <- packed_ds %>%\n  dataset_take(N_VALIDATION) %>%\n  dataset_cache()\ntrain_ds <- packed_ds %>%\n  dataset_skip(N_VALIDATION) %>%\n  dataset_take(N_TRAIN) %>%\n  dataset_cache()\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntrain_ds\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n<CacheDataset element_spec=(TensorSpec(shape=(28,), dtype=tf.float32, name=None), TensorSpec(shape=(), dtype=tf.float32, name=None))>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese datasets return individual examples.\nUse the `dataset_batch()` method to create batches of an appropriate size for training.\nBefore batching, also remember to use `dataset_shuffle()` and `dataset_repeat()` on the training set.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvalidate_ds <- validate_ds %>% dataset_batch(BATCH_SIZE)\ntrain_ds <- train_ds %>%\n  dataset_shuffle(BUFFER_SIZE) %>%\n  dataset_repeat() %>%\n  dataset_batch(BATCH_SIZE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Demonstrate overfitting\n\nThe simplest way to prevent overfitting is to start with a small model.\nA model with a small number of learnable parameters (which is determined by the number of layers and the number of units per layer).\nIn deep learning, the number of learnable parameters in a model is often referred to as the model's \"capacity\".\n\nIntuitively, a model with more parameters will have more \"memorization capacity\" and therefore will be able to easily learn a perfect dictionary-like mapping between training samples and their targets, a mapping without any generalization power, but this would be useless when making predictions on previously unseen data.\n\nAlways keep this in mind: deep learning models tend to be good at fitting to the training data, but the real challenge is generalization, not fitting.\n\nOn the other hand, if the network has limited memorization resources, it will not be able to learn the mapping as easily.\nTo minimize its loss, it will have to learn compressed representations that have more predictive power.\nAt the same time, if you make your model too small, it will have difficulty fitting to the training data.\nThere is a balance between \"too much capacity\" and \"not enough capacity\".\n\nUnfortunately, there is no magical formula to determine the right size or architecture of your model (in terms of the number of layers, or the right size for each layer).\nYou will have to experiment using a series of different architectures.\n\nTo find an appropriate model size, it's best to start with relatively few layers and parameters, then begin increasing the size of the layers or adding new layers until you see diminishing returns on the validation loss.\n\nStart with a simple model using only densely-connected layers (`tf$keras$layers$Dense`) as a baseline, then create larger models, and compare them.\n\n### Training procedure\n\nMany models train better if you gradually reduce the learning rate during training.\nUse `keras::learning_rate_schedule*` to reduce the learning rate over time:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlr_schedule <- learning_rate_schedule_inverse_time_decay(\n  0.001,\n  decay_steps = STEPS_PER_EPOCH*1000,\n  decay_rate = 1,\n  staircase = FALSE\n)\n\nget_optimizer <- function() {\n  optimizer_adam(lr_schedule)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe code above sets a `learning_rate_schedule_inverse_time_decay()` to hyperbolically decrease the learning rate to 1/2 of the base rate at 1,000 epochs, 1/3 at 2,000 epochs, and so on.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstep <- seq(1, 100000)\nlr <- lr_schedule(step)\ndata.frame(step = as.numeric(step), lr = as.numeric(lr)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = step, y = lr)) +\n  geom_line()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](overfit_and_underfit_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nEach model in this tutorial will use the same training configuration.\nSo set these up in a reusable way, starting with the list of callbacks.\n\nThe training for this tutorial runs for many short epochs.\n\nWe include `callback_early_stopping()` to avoid long and unnecessary training times.\nNote that this callback is set to monitor the `val_binary_crossentropy`, not the `val_loss`.\nThis difference will be important later.\n\nUse `callback_tensorboard()` to generate TensorBoard logs for the training.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nget_callbacks <- function(name) {\n  list(\n    callback_early_stopping(monitor = 'val_binary_crossentropy', patience = 200),\n    callback_tensorboard(file.path(logdir, name))\n  )\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nSimilarly each model will use the same `compile()` and `fit()` settings:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncompile_and_fit <- function(model, name, optimizer = NULL, max_epochs = 10000) {\n  if (is.null(optimizer)) {\n    optimizer <- get_optimizer()\n  }\n\n  model %>% compile(\n    optimizer = optimizer,\n    loss = loss_binary_crossentropy(from_logits = TRUE),\n    metrics = list(\n      loss_binary_crossentropy(from_logits = TRUE, name = \"binary_crossentropy\"),\n      \"accuracy\"\n    )\n  )\n\n  summary(model)\n\n  history <- model %>% fit(\n    train_ds,\n    steps_per_epoch = STEPS_PER_EPOCH,\n    epochs = max_epochs,\n    validation_data = validate_ds,\n    callbacks =

losses\n\nThe solid lines show the training loss, and the dashed lines show the validation loss (remember: a lower validation loss indicates a better model).\n\nWhile building a larger model gives it more power, if this power is not constrained somehow it can easily overfit to the training set.\n\nIn this example, typically, only the `\"Tiny\"` model manages to avoid overfitting altogether, and each of the larger models overfit the data more quickly.\nThis becomes so severe for the `\"large\"` model that you need to switch the plot to a log-scale to really figure out what's happening.\n\nThis is apparent if you plot and compare the validation metrics to the training metrics.\n\n-   It's normal for there to be a small difference.\n-   If both metrics are moving in the same direction, everything is fine.\n-   If the validation metric begins to stagnate while the training metric continues to improve, you are probably close to overfitting.\n-   If the validation metric is going in the wrong direction, the model is clearly overfitting.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching

{.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nregularizer_histories <- list()\nregularizer_histories[['Tiny']] <- size_histories[['Tiny']]\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Add weight regularization\n\nYou may be familiar with Occam's Razor principle: given two explanations for something, the explanation most likely to be correct is the \"simplest\" one, the one that makes the least amount of assumptions.\nThis also applies to the models learned by neural networks: given some training data and a network architecture, there are multiple sets of weights values (multiple models) that could explain the data, and simpler models are less likely to overfit than complex ones.\n\nA \"simple model\" in this context is a model where the distribution of parameter values has less entropy (or a model with fewer parameters altogether, as demonstrated in the section above).\nThus a common way to mitigate overfitting is to put constraints on the complexity of a network by forcing its weights only to take small values, which makes the distribution of weight values more \"regular\".\nThis is called \"weight regularization\", and it is done by adding to the loss function of the network a cost associated with(having large weights. This cost comes in two flavors, { })\n\n-   [L1 regularization](https://developers$google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#L1_regularization), where the cost added is proportional to the absolute value of the weights coefficients (i\\$e. to what is called the \"L1 norm\" of the weights).\n\n-   [L2 regularization](https://developers$google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#L2_regularization), where the cost added is proportional to the square of the value of the weights coefficients (i\\$e. to what is called the squared \"L2 norm\" of the weights).\n    L2 regularization is also called weight decay in the context of neural networks.\n    Don't let the different name confuse you: weight decay is mathematically the exact same as L2 regularization.\n\nL1 regularization pushes weights towards exactly zero, encouraging a sparse model.\nL2 regularization will penalize the weights parameters without making them sparse since the penalty goes to zero for small weights---one reason why L2 is more common.\n\nIn `tf$keras`, weight regularization is added by passing weight regularizer instances to layers as keyword arguments.\nAdd L2 weight regularization:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nl2_model <- keras_model_sequential() %>%\n  layer_dense(512, activation = 'elu',\n              kernel_regularizer = regularizer_l2(0.001),\n              input_shape <- shape(FEATURES)) %>%\n  layer_dense(512, activation = 'elu',\n              kernel_regularizer = regularizer_l2(0.001)) %>%\n  layer_dense(512, activation = 'elu',\n              kernel_regularizer = regularizer_l2(0.001)) %>%\n  layer_dense(512, activation = 'elu',\n              kernel_regularizer = regularizer_l2(0.001)) %>%\n  layer_dense(1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning in keras$regularizers$l2(l = l): partial argument match of 'l' to\n'l2'\n\nWarning in keras$regularizers$l2(l = l): partial argument match of 'l' to\n'l2'\n\nWarning in keras$regularizers$l2(l = l): partial argument match of 'l' to\n'l2'\n\nWarning in keras$regularizers$l2(l = l): partial argument match of 'l' to\n'l2'\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nregularizer_histories[['l2']] <- compile_and_fit(l2_model, \"regularizers/l2\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nModel: <no summary available, model was not built>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`l2(0.001)` means that every coefficient in the weight matrix of the layer will add `0.001 * weight_coefficient_value**2` to the total **loss** of the network.\n\nThat is why we're monitoring the `binary_crossentropy` directly.\nBecause it doesn't have this regularization component mixed in.\n\nSo, that same `\"Large\"` model with an `L2` regularization penalty performs much better:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_histories(regularizer_histories)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](overfit_and_underfit_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs demonstrated in the diagram above, the `\"L2\"` regularized model is now much more competitive with the `\"Tiny\"` model.\nThis `\"L2\"` model is also much more resistant to overfitting than the `\"Large\"` model it was based on despite having the same number of parameters.\n\n#### More info\n\nThere are two important things to note about this sort of regularization:\n\n1.  If you are writing your own training loop, then you need to be sure to ask the model for its regularization losses.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nresult <- l2_model(features)\nregularization_loss <- tf$add_n(l2_model$losses)\n```\n:::\n\n\n2.  This implementation works by adding the weight penalties to the model's loss, and then applying a standard optimization procedure after that.\n\nThere is a second approach that instead only runs the optimizer on the raw loss, and then while applying the calculated step the optimizer also applies some weight decay.\nThis \"decoupled weight decay\" is used in optimizers like `optimizer_ftrl()` and `optimizer_adamw()`.\n\n### Add dropout\n\nDropout is one of the most effective and most commonly used regularization techniques for neural networks, developed by Hinton and his students at the University of Toronto.\n\nThe intuitive explanation for dropout is that because individual nodes in the network cannot rely on the output of the others, each node must output features that are useful on their own.\n\nDropout, applied to a layer, consists of randomly \"dropping out\" (i\\$e. set to zero) a number of output features of the layer during training.\nFor example, a given layer would normally have returned a vector `[0.2, 0.5, 1.3, 0.8, 1.1]` for a given input sample during training; after applying dropout, this vector will have a few zero entries distributed at random, e.g. `[0, 0.5, 1.3, 0, 1.1]`.\n\nThe \"dropout rate\" is the fraction of the features that are being zeroed-out; it is usually set between 0.2 and 0.5.\nAt test time, no units are dropped out, and instead the layer's output values are scaled down by a factor equal to the dropout rate, so as to balance for the fact that more units are active than at training time.\n\nIn Keras, you can introduce dropout in a network via the `tf$keras$layers$Dropout` layer, which gets applied to the output of layer right before.\n\nAdd two dropout layers to your network to check how well they do at reducing overfitting:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndropout_model <- keras_model_sequential() %>%\n  layer_dense(512, activation = 'elu', input_shape = shape(FEATURES)) %>%\n  layer_dropout(0.5) %>%\n  layer_dense(512, activation = 'elu') %>%\n  layer_dropout(0.5) %>%\n  layer_dense(512, activation = 'elu') %>%\n  layer_dropout(0.5) %>%\n  layer_dense(512, activation = 'elu') %>%\n  layer_dropout(0.5) %>%\n  layer_dense(1)\n\nregularizer_histories[['dropout']] <- compile_and_fit(dropout_model, \"regularizers/dropout\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nModel: \"sequential_5\"\n____________________________________________________________________________\n Layer (type)                     Output Shape                  Param #
