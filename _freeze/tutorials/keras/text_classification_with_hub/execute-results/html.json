The acting is stunningly wonderful. The characters are very clearly drawn. Brad Pitt is simply superb as the errant son who rebels. The other actors and actresses are equally fine in every respect. Robert Redford creates a wonderful period piece from the days of speakeasies of the 1920s. The scenery is incredibly beautiful of the mountains and streams of western Montana. All in all, this is one of the finest films made in the 1990s.<br /><br />You must see this movie!<br /><br />', shape=(), dtype=string)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's also print the first 10 labels.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbatch[[2]][1:10]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\ntf.Tensor([1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0], shape=(10), dtype=int32)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Build the model\n\nThe neural network is created by stacking layers---this requires three main architectural decisions:\n\n-   How to represent the text?\n-   How many layers to use in the model?\n-   How many *hidden units* to use for each layer?\n\nIn this example, the input data consists of sentences.\nThe labels to predict are either 0 or 1.\n\nOne way to represent the text is to convert sentences into embeddings vectors.\nUse a pre-trained text embedding as the first layer, which will have three advantages:\n\n-   You don't have to worry about text preprocessing,\n-   Benefit from transfer learning,\n-   the embedding has a fixed size, so it's simpler to process.\n\nFor this example you use a **pre-trained text embedding model** from [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev) called [google/nnlm-en-dim50/2](https://tfhub.dev/google/nnlm-en-dim50/2).\n\nThere are many other pre-trained text embeddings from TFHub that can be used in this tutorial:\n\n-   [google/nnlm-en-dim128/2](https://tfhub.dev/google/nnlm-en-dim128/2) - trained with the same NNLM architecture on the same data as [google/nnlm-en-dim50/2](https://tfhub.dev/google/nnlm-en-dim50/2), but with a larger embedding dimension. Larger dimensional embeddings can improve on your task but it may take longer to train your model.\n-   [google/nnlm-en-dim128-with-normalization/2](https://tfhub.dev/google/nnlm-en-dim128-with-normalization/2) - the same as [google/nnlm-en-dim128/2](https://tfhub.dev/google/nnlm-en-dim128/2), but with additional text normalization such as removing punctuation. This can help if the text in your task contains additional characters or punctuation.\n-   [google/universal-sentence-encoder/4](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/4) - a much larger model yielding 512 dimensional embeddings trained with a deep averaging network (DAN) encoder.\n\nAnd many more!\nFind more [text embedding models](https://tfhub.dev/s?module-type%20=%20text-embedding) on TFHub.\n\nLet's first create a Keras layer that uses a TensorFlow Hub model to embed the sentences, and try it out on a couple of input examples.\nNote that no matter the length of the input text, the output shape of the embeddings is: `(num_examples, embedding_dimension)`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nembedding <- \"https://tfhub.dev/google/nnlm-en-dim50/2\"\nhub_layer <- tfhub::layer_hub(handle = embedding, trainable = TRUE)\nhub_layer(batch[[1]][1:2])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\ntf.Tensor(\n[[ 0.25639078  0.38771343  0.11458009  0.46377155 -0.27114585 -0.2354866\n  -0.05462556  0.05912565 -0.54671913  0.31118712 -0.16002831 -0.07053422\n  -0.24705385  0.09001825 -0.04209795 -0.33874807 -0.24183154 -0.3230999\n   0.10837324 -0.6382228   0.07474955 -0.47535452  0.40693292  0.31290907\n  -0.15077835  0.16694838 -0.63673955  0.18927398  0.44574216 -0.24568918\n  -0.46415138  0.2513454   0.14228602 -0.44085872 -0.2652811   0.09904837\n   0.18815234 -0.05307332  0.26779363 -0.6057924  -0.27559575  0.05044953\n  -0.48596275  0.21479745 -0.17461553 -0.6422216  -0.3165064  -0.33656728\n  -0.09484116 -0.07192937]\n [ 1.2899796   0.32863247 -0.00310844  0.8232223  -0.40982845 -0.5109542\n   0.08370162 -0.13269287 -1.1700541   0.55316675 -0.05031178  0.14853314\n  -0.15995869  0.26997143 -0.3404822  -0.49329752 -0.25939593  0.03390278\n   0.25013074 -1.417716    0.19143656 -0.2392007   1.2250862   0.41607675\n  -0.66565406  0.42407426 -1.2803619   0.47229245  0.53426725 -0.84027433\n  -0.7578848   0.44375423  0.57404596 -0.5191065  -0.67364585  0.6255407\n   0.54375225  0.22559978  0.17738008 -1.0557281   0.03807904  0.44274876\n  -0.45797464  0.17220229 -0.2047742  -0.3091375  -0.7907681  -0.723012\n   0.00783113 -0.0088165 ]], shape=(2, 50), dtype=float32)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's now build the full model:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel <- keras_model_sequential() %>%\n  hub_layer() %>%\n  layer_dense(16, activation = 'relu') %>%\n  layer_dense(1)\n\nsummary(model)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nModel: <no summary available, model was not built>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe layers are stacked sequentially to build the classifier:\n\n1.  The first layer is a TensorFlow Hub layer. This layer uses a pre-trained Saved Model to map a sentence into its embedding vector. The pre-trained text embedding model that you are using ([google/nnlm-en-dim50/2](https://tfhub.dev/google/nnlm-en-dim50/2)) splits the sentence into tokens, embeds each token and then combines the embedding. The resulting dimensions are: `(num_examples, embedding_dimension)`. For this NNLM model, the `embedding_dimension` is 50.\n2.  This fixed-length output vector is piped through a fully-connected (`Dense`) layer with 16 hidden units.\n3.  The last layer is densely connected with a single output node.\n\nLet's compile the model.\n\n### Loss function and optimizer\n\nA model needs a loss function and an optimizer for training.\nSince this is a binary classification problem and the model outputs logits (a single-unit layer with a linear activation), you'll use the `binary_crossentropy` loss function.\n\nThis isn't the only choice for a loss function, you could, for instance, choose `mean_squared_error`.\nBut, generally, `binary_crossentropy` is better for dealing with probabilities---it measures the \"distance\" between probability distributions, or in our case, between the ground-truth distribution and the predictions.\n\nLater, when you are exploring regression problems (say, to predict the price of a house), you'll see how to use another loss function called mean squared error.\n\nNow, configure the model to use an optimizer and a loss function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel %>% compile(\n  optimizer = 'adam',\n  loss = loss_binary_crossentropy(from_logits = TRUE),\n  metrics = 'accuracy'\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Train the model\n\nTrain the model for 10 epochs in mini-batches of 512 samples.\nThis is 10 iterations over all samples in the `x_train` and `y_train` tensors.\nWhile training, monitor the model's loss and accuracy on the 10,000 samples from the validation set:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhistory <- model %>% fit(\n  train_data,\n  epochs = 10,\n  validation_data = validation_data,\n  verbose <- 1\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nEpoch 1/10\n40/40 - 7s - loss: 0.6709 - accuracy: 0.5359 - val_loss: 0.6068 - val_accuracy: 0.5898 - 7s/epoch - 185ms/step\nEpoch 2/10\n40/40 - 6s - loss: 0.5228 - accuracy: 0.7199 - val_loss: 0.4656 - val_accuracy: 0.7564 - 6s/epoch - 139ms/step\nEpoch 3/10\n40/40 - 6s - loss: 0.3635 - accuracy: 0.8497 - val_loss: 0.3603 - val_accuracy: 0.8534 - 6s/epoch - 138ms/step\nEpoch 4/10\n40/40 - 6s - loss: 0.2542 - accuracy: 0.9058 - val_loss: 0.3118 - val_accuracy: 0.8622 - 6s/epoch - 138ms/step\nEpoch 5/10\n40/40 - 5s - loss: 0.1857 - accuracy: 0.9344 - val_loss: 0.2944 - val_accuracy: 0.8696 - 5s/epoch - 135ms/step\nEpoch 6/10\n40/40 - 5s - loss: 0.1367 - accuracy: 0.9559 - val_loss: 0.2943 - val_accuracy: 0.8788 - 5s/epoch - 135ms/step\nEpoch 7/10\n40/40 - 6s - loss: 0.0994 - accuracy: 0.9719 - val_loss: 0.2959 - val_accuracy: 0.8726 - 6s/epoch - 138ms/step\nEpoch 8/10\n40/40 - 5s - loss: 0.0722 - accuracy: 0.9811 - val_loss: 0.3052 - val_accuracy: 0.8768 - 5s/epoch - 132ms/step\nEpoch 9/10\n40/40 - 4s - loss: 0.0510 - accuracy: 0.9898 - val_loss: 0.3189 - val_accuracy: 0.8750 - 4s/epoch - 103ms/step\nEpoch 10/10\n40/40 - 5s - loss: 0.0370 - accuracy: 0.9947 - val_loss: 0.3334 - val_accuracy: 0.8722 - 5s/epoch - 118ms/step\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Evaluate the model\n\nAnd let's see how the model performs.\nTwo values will be returned.\nLoss (a number which represents our error, lower values are better), and accuracy.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nresults <- model %>% evaluate(test_data, verbose = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n49/49 - 1s - loss: 0.3672 - accuracy: 0.8560 - 651ms/epoch - 13ms/step\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nresults\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n     loss  accuracy \n0.3672312 0.8559600 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis fairly naive approach achieves an accuracy of about 87%.\nWith more advanced approaches, the model should get closer to 95%.\n\n## Further reading\n\n-   For a more general way to work with string inputs and for a more detailed analysis of the progress of accuracy and loss during training, see the [Text classification with preprocessed text](./text_classification.qmd) tutorial.\n-   Try out more [text-related tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials#text-related-tutorials) using trained models from TFHub.\n",
