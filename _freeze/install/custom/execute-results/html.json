If you have an existing installation\nof TensorFlow or just prefer your own custom installation that's fine\ntoo.\n\nThe full instructions for installing TensorFlow on various platforms are\nhere: <https://www.tensorflow.org/install/>. After installing, please\nrefer to the sections below on locating TensorFlow and meeting\nadditional dependencies to ensure that the tensorflow for R package\nfunctions correctly with your installation.\n\n### Locating TensorFlow\n\nOnce you've installed TensorFlow you need to ensure that the tensorflow\nfor R package can find your installation. The package scans the system\nfor various versions of Python, and also scans available virtual\nenvironments and conda environments, so in many cases things will just\nwork without additional effort.\n\nIf the version of TensorFlow you installed is not found automatically,\nthen you can use the following techniques to ensure that TensorFlow is\nlocated.\n\nSpecify the `RETICULATE_PYTHON` environment variable to force probing\nwithin a specific Python installation. For example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON=\"/usr/local/bin/python\")\nlibrary(tensorflow)\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou could also add the `RETICULATE_PYTHON` environment variable to your\n`.Rprofile` or `.Renviron`.\n\nAlternatively, call the `use_python()` family of configuration\nfunctions:\n\n| Function           | Description                                           |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| `use_python()`     | Specify the path a specific Python binary.            |\n| `use_virtualenv()` | Specify the directory containing a Python virtualenv. |\n| `use_condaenv()`   | Specify the name of a conda environment.              |\n\nFor example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tensorflow)\nuse_virtualenv(\"my_env\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Additional Dependencies\n\nThere are some components of TensorFlow (e.g. the\n[Keras](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/python/keras)\nlibrary) which have dependencies on additional Python packages. The\n`install_keras()` function installs these dependencies automatically,\nhowever if you do a custom installation you should be sure to install\nthem manually.\n\nYou can install the additional dependencies with the following command:\n\n\n\n``` bash\npip install tensorflow-hub tensorflow-datasets scipy requests Pillow h5py pandas pydot\n```\n\n\n## Supported Platforms\n\nNote that binary installations of TensorFlow are provided for Windows,\nOS X, and Ubuntu 16.04 or higher. It's possible that binary\ninstallations will work on other Linux variants but Ubuntu is the only\nplatform tested and supported.\n",
