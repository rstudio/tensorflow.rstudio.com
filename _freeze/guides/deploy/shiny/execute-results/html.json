Here's\nhow we can structure our Shiny app.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(keras)\n\n# Load the model\nmodel <- load_model_tf(\"cnn-mnist/\")\n\n# Define the UI\nui <- fluidPage(\n  # App title ----\n  titlePanel(\"Hello TensorFlow!\"),\n  # Sidebar layout with input and output definitions ----\n  sidebarLayout(\n    # Sidebar panel for inputs ----\n    sidebarPanel(\n      # Input: File upload\n      fileInput(\"image_path\", label = \"Input a JPEG image\")\n    ),\n    # Main panel for displaying outputs ----\n    mainPanel(\n      # Output: Histogram ----\n      textOutput(outputId = \"prediction\"),\n      plotOutput(outputId = \"image\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n# Define server logic required to draw a histogram ----\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  \n  image <- reactive({\n    req(input$image_path)\n    jpeg::readJPEG(input$image_path$datapath)\n  })\n  \n  output$prediction <- renderText({\n    \n    img <- image() %>% \n      array_reshape(., dim = c(1, dim(.), 1))\n    \n    paste0(\"The predicted class number is \", predict_classes(model, img))\n  })\n  \n  output$image <- renderPlot({\n    plot(as.raster(image()))\n  })\n  \n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis app can be used locally or deployed using any Shiny deployment option.\nIf you are deploying to RStudio Connect or Shinnyapps.io, don't forget to set the `RETICULATE_PYTHON` environment variable so `rsconnect` can detect what python\npackages are required to reproduce your local environment. See the [F.A.Q.](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016990813-FAQ-for-Using-Python-with-RStudio-Connect) for more information.\n\n![](images/shiny.png)\n\nYou can see a live version of this app [here](https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/7325/). Note that to keep the code simple, it will only accept JPEG images with 28x28 pixels. You can download [this file](images/mnist.jpeg) if you want to try the app.\n\n## More advanced models\n\nWhen building more advanced models you may not be able to save the entire model using the `save_model_tf` function. In this case you can use the `save_model_weights_tf` function. \n\nFor example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsave_model_weights_tf(model, \" cnn-model-weights\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen, in the `api.R` file whenn loading the model you will need to rebuild the model using the exact same code that you used when training and saving and then use `load_model_weights_tf` to load\nthe model weights.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel <- keras_model_sequential() %>% \n  layer_conv_2d(filters = 16, kernel_size = c(3,3), activation = \"relu\") %>% \n  layer_max_pooling_2d(pool_size = c(2,2)) %>% \n  layer_conv_2d(filters = 16, kernel_size = c(3,3), activation = \"relu\") %>% \n  layer_max_pooling_2d(pool_size = c(2,2)) %>% \n  layer_flatten() %>% \n  layer_dense(units = 128, activation = \"relu\") %>% \n  layer_dense(units = 10, activation = \"softmax\")\n\nload_model_weights_tf(model, \"cnn-model-weights\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Hosting the shiny app\n\nThis Shiny app can be hosted in any server using the Shiny Server. If you are managing the complete infrastructure, make sure that you have Python and all required Python packages\ninstalled in the server. \n\nIf you are using [Shinyapps.io](https://shinyapps.io) or [RStudio Connect](https://rstudio.com/products/connect/) the dependencies will be infered when deploying the app. In this case, don't forget to set the `RETICULATE_PYTHON` environment variable.\n\nYou can find more examples of using reticulate in RStudio products [here](https://github.com/sol-eng/python-examples) and learn more about Python in \nRStudio Connect best practices [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022909454-Best-Practices-for-Using-Python-with-RStudio-Connect).\n\n\n\n",
