# Welcome to TensorFlow for R

### An end-to-end open source machine learning platform

<br> <br> <br>

-   Build and train deep learning models easily with high-level API's like Keras and TF Datasets.
-   Iterate rapidly and debug easily with eager execution.
-   Scale computations to accelerators like GPUs, TPUs, and clusters with graph execution.
-   Deploy models to the cloud, on-prem, in the browser, or on-device.
-   A comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets beginners quickly get started, researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML, and engineers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.
